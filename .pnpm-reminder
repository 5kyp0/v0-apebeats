# PNPM USAGE REMINDER
# ===================

This project uses PNPM as the package manager instead of npm.

## Why PNPM?
- Faster installation and updates
- More efficient disk usage through hard linking
- Better dependency resolution
- Already configured with pnpm-lock.yaml

## Commands to use:
- `pnpm install` (instead of npm install)
- `pnpm add <package>` (instead of npm install <package>)
- `pnpm run <script>` (instead of npm run <script>)
- `pnpm dev` (instead of npm run dev)
- `pnpm build` (instead of npm run build)

## Always use PNPM for:
- Installing dependencies
- Adding new packages
- Running scripts
- Building the project
- Any package management operations
