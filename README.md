## ApeChain data under the player

- We fetch via Alchemy ApeChain API through Thirdweb RPC client:
  - `eth_blockNumber` → displayed as BLOCK
  - `eth_gasPrice` → displayed as GAS in gwei
- **Rate Limiting**: Updates every 30 seconds to stay within Alchemy free tier limits
  - Free tier: 100M compute units/month, 25 RPS
  - Each request: ~10 CUs (eth_blockNumber) + ~10 CUs (eth_gasPrice) = 20 CUs
  - 30-second intervals = ~86,400 requests/month = ~1.7M CUs/month (well within limits)
- `TXN/MIN` is currently shown as "-" placeholder. To enable it:
  - Poll latest block number every N seconds
  - Fetch block details for the latest and previous block(s)
  - Derive tx/min from tx count and expected block time
  - Or integrate a subgraph/indexer that provides a rolling tx rate

## Deployment tips

- Vercel
  - Add env vars in Project Settings → Environment Variables
  - Redeploy

- Security
  - Never commit secret keys. Only the Thirdweb client id is public.
  - RPC URLs can be public if rate-limited; consider private RPCs for production.

## 🔗 **Glyph Wallet Integration & WalletTransactionService**

### **How We Made Glyph Wallet Work**

The integration of Glyph wallet with our batch transfer system required solving several complex challenges. Here's how we successfully implemented a unified wallet transaction service that works seamlessly with both ThirdWeb and Glyph wallets.

#### **The Challenge**
- **Different Transaction Formats**: ThirdWeb and Glyph wallets use different transaction formats and APIs
- **Contract Interaction**: Each wallet type requires different methods for contract interaction
- **Error Handling**: Different error types and handling mechanisms
- **State Management**: Different wallet state management approaches

#### **The Solution: WalletTransactionService**

We created a unified `WalletTransactionService` class that abstracts away the differences between wallet types:

```typescript
export interface WalletInfo {
  type: 'thirdweb' | 'glyph'
  account?: any
  address?: string
  signer?: any
  sendTransaction?: (transaction: {
    to: string
    data: string
    value: string
    chainId: number
  }) => Promise<string>
}
```

#### **Key Implementation Details**

##### **1. Unified Transaction Execution**
```typescript
async executeTransaction(
  walletInfo: WalletInfo,
  contractMethod: string,
  params: any[],
  value?: bigint
): Promise<{ transactionHash: string }>
```

The service automatically detects the wallet type and uses the appropriate transaction method:
- **ThirdWeb**: Uses `prepareContractCall` and `sendTransaction`
- **Glyph**: Uses `encodeFunctionData` and `sendTransaction` with custom format

##### **2. Dynamic Gas Price Calculation**
```typescript
// Get current gas price for Curtis testnet (APE)
let gasPrice = BigInt(1000000000) // Default 1 Gwei fallback
try {
  const { createPublicClient, http } = await import("viem")
  const { curtis } = await import("./chains")
  const client = createPublicClient({
    chain: curtis,
    transport: http(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL || "https://curtis.rpc.caldera.xyz/http")
  })
  const networkGasPrice = await client.getGasPrice()
  gasPrice = networkGasPrice
} catch (error) {
  console.log("🔍 Could not fetch gas price, using default:", gasPrice.toString())
}
```

##### **3. Contract Method Encoding**
For Glyph wallets, we manually encode contract method calls:
```typescript
// Encode the function call data using the full contract ABI
const { encodeFunctionData } = await import("viem")
const data = encodeFunctionData({
  abi: contractABI,
  functionName: contractMethod,
  args: params
})
```

##### **4. Transaction Format Adaptation**
```typescript
// Create the transaction object in the format expected by Glyph
const transaction = {
  to: contractAddress,
  data: data,
  value: value?.toString() || "0",
  chainId: curtisChainId
}

// Use Glyph's sendTransaction with the correct format
const txHash = await walletInfo.signer.sendTransaction({ transaction })
```

#### **Token Approval Handling**

For ERC20 tokens, we implemented automatic approval checking and execution:

```typescript
async checkAndApproveTokens(
  walletInfo: WalletInfo, 
  amount: string, 
  tokenAddress?: Address
): Promise<void>
```

The service:
1. Checks current allowance for the token
2. Compares with required amount
3. Automatically requests approval if needed
4. Handles the approval transaction

#### **Error Handling & Validation**

Comprehensive error handling ensures robust operation:

```typescript
// Validate transaction before sending
if (!transaction.to || transaction.to === "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000") {
  throw new Error("Invalid contract address")
}

if (!transaction.data || transaction.data === "0x" || transaction.data.length < 10) {
  throw new Error("Invalid transaction data")
}
```

#### **Benefits of This Approach**

1. **Unified Interface**: Single API for all wallet types
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper types
3. **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
4. **Maintainability**: Easy to add new wallet types
5. **Performance**: Optimized for each wallet's specific requirements

#### **Usage in Components**

Components can now use the unified service without worrying about wallet types:

```typescript
const walletInfo = getWalletInfo() // Automatically detects wallet type

// Execute transaction using unified service
const receipt = await walletTransactionService.executeTransaction(
  walletInfo,
  "batchTransferEqual",
  [recipients, BigInt(amountPerRecipient)],
  totalWithFee
)
```

#### **Testing & Debugging**

The service includes comprehensive logging for debugging:

```typescript
console.log("🔍 executeTransaction called with:", { 
  walletType: walletInfo.type, 
  method: contractMethod, 
  params, 
  value 
})
```

This makes it easy to debug issues and monitor transaction execution across different wallet types.

### **Result**

The `WalletTransactionService` successfully enables:
- ✅ **Seamless Glyph Integration**: Full support for Glyph wallet transactions
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing ThirdWeb functionality remains unchanged
- ✅ **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can choose their preferred wallet
- ✅ **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- ✅ **Future-Proof Architecture**: Easy to add support for additional wallet types

This implementation demonstrates how to create a unified wallet abstraction layer that handles the complexities of different wallet APIs while providing a clean, consistent interface for the application.
