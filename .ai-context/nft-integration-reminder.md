# NFT Integration Reminder

## ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL PROJECT GOAL
**The generative music engine MUST be designed with NFT snapshot integration as a core requirement from day one.**

## ðŸš¨ Key Reminders for AI Assistant

### Always Consider:
1. **NFT Metadata**: Every generated music piece needs metadata for NFT creation
2. **Provenance**: Track original blockchain data that generated each piece
3. **Storage**: Plan for decentralized storage of audio files
4. **Uniqueness**: Ensure each generation produces unique, verifiable results
5. **Smart Contracts**: Design with ERC-721/ERC-1155 compatibility

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Modular Design**: Each component should support NFT snapshot functionality
- **Data Preservation**: Never lose the connection between blockchain data and generated music
- **Quality Standards**: Maintain audio quality suitable for NFT marketplace
- **Scalability**: Support batch NFT creation and management

### Development Approach:
- **Future-Proof**: Build with NFT integration in mind, not as an afterthought
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear data flow documentation for NFT metadata
- **Testing**: Include NFT creation scenarios in testing
- **Performance**: Optimize for NFT generation workflows

## ðŸ“‹ Checklist for Every Feature:
- [ ] Does this support NFT snapshot creation?
- [ ] Is the data flow documented for NFT metadata?
- [ ] Can this generate unique, verifiable outputs?
- [ ] Is the storage strategy NFT-compatible?
- [ ] Are there any limitations that would prevent NFT integration?

## ðŸŽµ Music Engine Specific:
- **Unique Seeds**: Use blockchain data as deterministic seeds
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure same data produces same music
- **Variation**: Allow for controlled randomness within deterministic bounds
- **Quality**: Maintain professional audio standards
- **Metadata**: Include all generation parameters in NFT metadata
