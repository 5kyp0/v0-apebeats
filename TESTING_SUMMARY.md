## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
- **Frontend**: Development server running successfully
- **Environment**: Curtis Testnet configuration complete
- **Music Engine**: Core functionality fixed and working
- **Test Infrastructure**: Jest setup with proper mocks
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides created

### ⏳ Pending Setup (Requires Your Action)
- **Private Key**: Need to add to `.env.local` for contract deployment
- **Testnet Tokens**: Need to get APE tokens from Curtis Testnet faucet
- **Contract Deployment**: Ready to deploy once private key is added

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Add Private Key**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env.local and add:
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   ```

2. **Get Testnet Tokens**:
   - Visit: https://faucet.curtis.apechain.xyz
   - Request tokens for: `0x32cDaA9429365153Cf7BE048f42152945d99399d`

3. **Deploy Contracts**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy
   ```

4. **Run Full Test Suite**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run test:all
   ```

## 🧪 Testing Commands Available

```bash
# Comprehensive testing
pnpm run test:all          # Run all tests and start dev server
pnpm run test:debug        # Same as test:all

# Individual test suites
pnpm test                  # Frontend tests
pnpm run test:contracts    # Contract tests (after deployment)
pnpm run test:coverage     # Coverage report

# Deployment
pnpm run deploy           # Deploy to Curtis Testnet
pnpm run env:curtis       # Update environment for Curtis

# Development
pnpm dev                  # Start development server
```

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Jest Configuration
- **Problem**: ESM module imports failing
- **Solution**: Updated `transformIgnorePatterns` to include all necessary packages
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Music Engine Errors
- **Problem**: `crypto.subtle` not available in Node.js
- **Solution**: Added fallback hash implementation
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. Test Environment
