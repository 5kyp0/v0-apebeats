# ApeBeats Testing & Debugging Setup Guide

## 🚨 Current Status

The testing and debugging setup is **partially complete**. Here's what we've accomplished and what still needs to be done:

## ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Environment Configuration**: Updated `.env.local` for Curtis Testnet
2. **Test Infrastructure**: Enhanced Jest configuration with proper mocks
3. **Music Engine Fixes**: Fixed crypto.subtle and validation issues
4. **Comprehensive Testing Scripts**: Created `test-and-debug.js` script
5. **Documentation**: Created debugging guides and setup instructions

## ⚠️ Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Jest Configuration Issues
- **Problem**: ESM module imports not being handled properly
- **Solution**: Updated `transformIgnorePatterns` in `jest.config.js`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Music Engine Errors
- **Problem**: Missing crypto.subtle in test environment
- **Solution**: Added fallback hash implementation
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. Test Environment Setup
- **Problem**: Missing Web Audio API and Canvas mocks
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive mocks in `jest.setup.js`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## 🔧 Required Setup Steps

### 1. Add Private Key (REQUIRED FOR DEPLOYMENT)

You need to add your wallet private key to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Add this line to your .env.local file
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

**⚠️ Security Note**: Never commit your private key to version control!

### 2. Get Testnet APE Tokens

Visit the Curtis Testnet faucet to get testnet APE tokens:
- **Faucet URL**: [Curtis Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.curtis.apechain.xyz)
- **Your Address**: `0x32cDaA9429365153Cf7BE048f42152945d99399d`

### 3. Deploy Contracts

Once you have the private key and testnet tokens:

```bash
# Deploy contracts to Curtis Testnet
pnpm run deploy

# Test deployed contracts
pnpm run test:contracts
```

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Frontend Tests
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partially Working
- **Issues**: Some JSDOM compatibility issues remain
- **Coverage**: Tests run but with some failures

### Music Engine Tests
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
- **Issues**: Crypto.subtle and validation errors resolved
- **Coverage**: Core functionality working

### Contract Tests
- **Status**: ⏳ Pending Deployment
- **Issues**: Cannot test without deployed contracts
- **Coverage**: Ready to test once deployed

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Add Private Key**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env.local and add:
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   ```

2. **Get Testnet Tokens**:
   - Visit Curtis Testnet faucet
   - Request tokens for your address

3. **Deploy Contracts**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy
   ```

4. **Run Full Test Suite**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run test:all
   ```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm run test:all

# Run specific test suites
pnpm test                    # Frontend tests
pnpm run test:contracts      # Contract tests (after deployment)
pnpm run test:coverage       # Coverage report

# Deploy and test contracts
pnpm run deploy             # Deploy to Curtis Testnet
pnpm run test:contracts     # Test deployed contracts

# Start development server
pnpm dev                    # Start local development server
```

## 🔍 Debugging Tools

### 1. Comprehensive Testing Script
```bash
# Run the comprehensive testing script
pnpm run test:all
```

This script will:
- Check environment configuration
- Run frontend tests
- Deploy contracts (if private key is set)
- Test deployed contracts
- Test music engine
- Test integration
- Generate test report
- Start development server

### 2. Individual Test Commands
```bash
# Test specific components
pnpm test -- --testPathPattern="music-engine"
pnpm test -- --testPathPattern="walletConnection"
pnpm test -- --testPathPattern="ErrorBoundary"
```

### 3. Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug mode
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_MODE=true pnpm dev
```

## 📊 Current Test Results

### Passing Tests
- ✅ Basic utility functions
- ✅ Error boundary components
- ✅ Loading state components
- ✅ Music engine core functionality (with fixes)

### Failing Tests
- ❌ Some integration tests (JSDOM issues)
- ❌ Contract tests (pending deployment)
- ❌ Some music engine tests (environment issues)

### Coverage Status
- **Target**: 70% minimum
- **Current**: ~60% (estimated)
- **Status**: Needs improvement after deployment

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### 1. JSDOM Compatibility
- **Issue**: Some tests fail due to JSDOM limitations
- **Solution**: Enhanced mocks in `jest.setup.js`
- **Status**: Mostly resolved

### 2. Crypto.subtle Availability
- **Issue**: Not available in Node.js test environment
- **Solution**: Added fallback hash implementation
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. Web Audio API
- **Issue**: Not available in test environment
- **Solution**: Comprehensive mocks added
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
